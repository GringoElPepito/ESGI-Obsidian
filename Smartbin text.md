# The Problem

We have identified 3 problems to bo solved regarding waste sorting
## **Time:**  
Properly sorting waste requires user effort and awareness. In busy households or companies, this task is often rushed or skipped altogether, leading to environmental inefficiencies.

## **Error:**  
Statistically, _almost 40% of waste is misclassified_, meaning recyclables end up in landfills and non-recyclables pollute recycling streams. This drastically reduces recycling effectiveness and increases processing costs for municipalities.

## **Space:**  
Having separate bins for plastic, paper, organic, and general waste occupies considerable space, especially in smaller homes or offices where optimization is key.
