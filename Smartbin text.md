# Introduction

In a world increasingly aware of the environmental impact of waste, **Smartbin** offers a cutting-edge, intelligent solution to a daily problem. Our mission? To make waste sorting effortless, accurate, and space-efficient.

# The Problem

We have identified 3 problems to bo solved regarding waste sorting
## **Time:**  
Properly sorting waste requires user effort and awareness. In busy households or companies, this task is often rushed or skipped altogether, leading to environmental inefficiencies.

## **Error:**  
Statistically, _almost 40% of waste is misclassified_, meaning recyclables end up in landfills and non-recyclables pollute recycling streams. This drastically reduces recycling effectiveness and increases processing costs for municipalities.

## **Space:**  
Having separate bins for plastic, paper, organic, and general waste occupies considerable space, especially in smaller homes or offices where optimization is key.

# Our Solution

Smartbin uses **artificial intelligence** and **machine vision** to instantly recognize and classify various types of wasteâ€”plastic, glass, paper, organic matter, etc. Once detected, a **mechanical sorting system** directs the item into the correct internal compartment. This eliminates the need for multiple bins and user guesswork.

**Started in early 2022**, our research and development team focused on machine learning, object detection, and robotics integration.
