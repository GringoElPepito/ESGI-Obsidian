# Introduction

In a world increasingly aware of the environmental impact of waste, **Smartbin** offers a cutting-edge, intelligent solution to a daily problem. Our mission? To make waste sorting effortless, accurate, and space-efficient.

# The Problem

We have identified 3 problems to bo solved regarding waste sorting
## **Time:**  
Properly sorting waste requires user effort and awareness. In busy households or companies, this task is often rushed or skipped altogether, leading to environmental inefficiencies.

## **Error:**  
Statistically, _almost 40% of waste is misclassified_, meaning recyclables end up in landfills and non-recyclables pollute recycling streams. This drastically reduces recycling effectiveness and increases processing costs for municipalities.

## **Space:**  
Having separate bins for plastic, paper, organic, and general waste occupies considerable space, especially in smaller homes or offices where optimization is key.

# Our Solution

Smartbin uses **artificial intelligence** and **machine vision** to instantly recognize and classify various types of waste—plastic, glass, paper, organic matter, etc. Once detected, a **mechanical sorting system** directs the item into the correct internal compartment. This eliminates the need for multiple bins and user guesswork.

**Started in early 2022**, our research and development team focused on machine learning, object detection, and robotics integration.

After almost 3 years, we have succeeded in designing the first marketable version of our product. We started selling it at the beginning of 2025.

Our products can be purchased directly from our website, which is accessible 24/7.
