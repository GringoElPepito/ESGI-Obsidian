# Introduction

In a world increasingly aware of the environmental impact of waste, **Smartbin** offers a cutting-edge, intelligent solution to a daily problem. Our mission? To make waste sorting effortless, accurate, and space-efficient.

# The Problem

We have identified 3 problems to be solved regarding waste sorting
## **Time:**  
Properly sorting waste requires user effort and awareness. In busy households or companies, this task is often rushed or skipped altogether, leading to environmental inefficiencies.

## **Error:**  
Statistically, _almost 40% of waste is misclassified_, meaning recyclables end up in landfills and non-recyclables pollute recycling streams. This drastically reduces recycling effectiveness and increases processing costs for municipalities.

## **Space:**  
Having separate bins for plastic, paper, organic, and general waste occupies considerable space, especially in smaller homes or offices where optimization is key.

# Our Solution

Smartbin uses **artificial intelligence** and **machine vision** to instantly recognize and classify various types of waste—plastic, glass, paper, organic matter, etc. Once detected, a **mechanical sorting system** directs the item into the correct internal compartment. This eliminates the need for multiple bins and user guesswork.

**Started in early 2022**, our research and development team focused on machine learning, object detection, and robotics integration.

After almost 3 years, we have succeeded in designing the first marketable version of our product. We started selling it at the beginning of 2025.

Our products can be purchased directly from our website, which is accessible 24/7.

# Our Products

The sale of our product is divided into 2 parts, a single purchase for the product itself and a non-binding subscription offering maintenance and bags for the various compartments. 
You can also use others bag than ours, it's just that our system work better with our bags. The bags doesn't concern the industrial model because it doesn't use it.

We currently offer 3 different versions of our product :
-  The tiny version, priced at 350€, costs 200€ to produce and takes 4 days to assemble. The subscription is 30€ per month. This version is aimed primarily at individuals and small businesses.
- The medium version, priced at 800€, costs 350€ to produce and takes 5 days to assemble. The subscription is 100€ per month. This version is aimed at medium-sized and large companies.
- The industrial model is a custom-built version designed specifically for waste treatment centers. We tailor its creation to the size of the center, and the types and quantities of waste processed.
# Location

Our factory is currently located in Taiwan. We have a warehouse in Portugal and our head office is located in France near Paris. Products are shipped directly from the Taiwan factory to our warehouse before being delivered to our customers.

# Market

The market in which we operate is one in which there are currently no major players. Intelligent waste recycling has not yet been democratized, which represents a great opportunity.

What's more, people are becoming increasingly aware of the problem of global warming, so there's plenty of potential new customers who could be interested in our product.

# Table of sales

Here are our sales figures since the start of 2025. As you can see, we've almost multiplied our sales of the tiny version by 7 between January and May. 
As for the medium version, we multiplied our sales by 8.5 over the same period. 
In addition, we made two sales of our industrial model between April and May.
All in all, we achieved sales of 394260€ (three hundred ninety-four thousand two hundred and sixty) on only five month. 
# Futur & Previsions

Let's get on with our roadmap. For 2026, we aim to open our first European factory in Portugal, which will enable us to reduce our delivery times. By 2028, we aim to deploy 50 industrial models across Europe. Finally, by 2030 we aim to create a building-integrated version of Smartbin.

# Marketing
Now it's time to show you how we achieved this result. We have implemented 4 points:
- The first is a free trial month for the first 100 customers every month.
- The second is the development of our image on social networks, via ads or partnerships with influencers.
